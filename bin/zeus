# When changing file contents and running tests with Zeus, the command  will
# often fail (at least on my machine) with error "Terminated 15", and a status
# code of 143. Retrying would eventually get it to run, but it would sometimes
# take like 6 retries on every test which got incredibly annoying.
# More info here: https://github.com/burke/zeus/issues/598

# This wrapper (having it in a directory that's somewhere in your PATH with
# precedence over any rbenv stuff) will automatically keep retrying Zeus until
# this error goes away. Fun times.

# Also, we may want to set the OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY env variable
# because there is sometimes a weird error that you can read about here:
# https://github.com/burke/zeus/issues/617
# This hasn't been an issue lately though. If you run into this, use
# zeus --log ./zeus.log start
# and try to debug from there
