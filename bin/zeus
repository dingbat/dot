# When changing file contents and running tests with Zeus, the command  will
# often fail (at least on my machine) with error "Terminated 15", and a status
# code of 143. Retrying would eventually get it to run, but it would sometimes
# take like 6 retries on every test which got incredibly annoying.

# This wrapper (having it in a directory that's somewhere in your PATH with
# precedence over any RVM stuff) will automatically keep retrying Zeus until
# this error goes away. Fun times.
